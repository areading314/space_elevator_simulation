# space_elevator_simulation
Mechanical simulation of a space elevator

Assumptions:
Assume planet is large compared to mechanical elements -> gravity only acts along y-direction (so does rotational centripetal force)



TODO:
1. Gravitational Field
2. Particle motion under gravity
3. Connected particles, measure tension
